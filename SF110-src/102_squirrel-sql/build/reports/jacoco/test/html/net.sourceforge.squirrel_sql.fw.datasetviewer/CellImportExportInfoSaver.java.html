/**
 * @author gwg
 *
 * Save and return Import/Export file name and command
 * based on table+column name.  Also allow for load and dump of all data
 * on application startup/shutdown.
 * 
 * There should be only one mapping from table+column to import/export info
 * for the entire application, so this is a singleton class.
 * To access the table, other classes must call
 * CellImportExportInfoSaver.getInstance() to get the singleton instance to use.
 * 
 * The loading of this from the file is particularly finicky since it involves
 * the XMLBean Reader class creating an empty instance of the class and loading
 * that instance from the file, then passing that instance in to become the 
 * singleton used by the rest of the framework.  Other loading done during startup
 * (e.g. SQLHistory) is simpler because the data is &quot;owned&quot; by the application-level
 * code, so the singleton is kept there (e.g. _sqlHistory in Application.java).
 * That does not make sense here because this data is &quot;owned&quot; and used only by
 * the fw code.
